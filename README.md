A browser-based Epub reader with an emphasis on a clean reading experience. 

## Features

* Reasonable typography – like a reader mode for ebooks.
* Remembers your last location in the book.
* Private – your books and reading history are stored locally in your browser cache.
* Dark mode


Todo:
* ~~Add option to delete books from library~~
* Add option to save bookmarks
* Clean up code

Limitations:
* Only works with DRM-free epubs.
* Doesn't work well with ebooks where every page is an image.
